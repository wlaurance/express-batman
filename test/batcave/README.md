# Welcome to batman.js!

This is a blank app template to help get you started.

## Running the app

Unfortunately, due to awesome browser security things, you can't run index.html directly from the directory. You can use literally any server mechanism as long as you're running the app from behind localhost.

Here's a simple one:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from inside this directory.

Now you can access this sample app from **http://localhost:8000**.

If you see "Welcome to batman.js!", you're all good!

### Happy Crimefighting
